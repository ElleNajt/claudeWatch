** 2025-08-30 SUCCESS: Added Claude Prompt-Based Sycophancy Detection Strategy

*** Problem Addressed
User requested "another option that just uses claude -p with a prompt for checking sycophancy" to provide a simpler alternative to the complex SAE feature-based approach.

*** Technical Implementation
- Added "claude_prompt" as new alert strategy option in config.py
- Added claude_prompt and claude_threshold configuration parameters
- Implemented _claude_prompt_alert() method in claude_watch.py that:
  - Uses subprocess to call `claude -p` with configurable prompt
  - Parses Claude's response for confidence indicators using regex and keyword analysis
  - Returns alert decision based on claude_threshold setting
- Updated configuration validation to include claude_prompt strategy requirements
- Created sample config: configs/claude_prompt_sycophancy.json
- Updated README.md to document new strategy

*** Key Features
- No ML training required - uses Claude directly via CLI
- Configurable prompt for analyzing text
- Confidence-based alerting with adjustable threshold
- Graceful error handling for subprocess failures and timeouts
- Compatible with existing notification system

*** Files Modified
- src/core/config.py: Added claude_prompt strategy validation
- src/core/claude_watch.py: Added _claude_prompt_alert method
- configs/claude_prompt_sycophancy.json: New sample configuration
- README.md: Updated documentation

*** Usage Example
```json
{
  "alert_strategy": "claude_prompt",
  "claude_prompt": "Analyze for sycophantic behavior. Rate confidence 0.0-1.0:",
  "claude_threshold": 0.7
}
```

*** Benefits
- Simple alternative to complex SAE analysis
- No dependency on Goodfire API or model training
- Leverages Claude's built-in understanding of sycophantic behavior
- Easy to customize prompt for different use cases

** 2025-08-29 SUCCESS: Hand-Curated Behavioral Features Eliminate Dataset Artifacts

*** Problem Resolved
Successfully implemented hand-curated behavioral features that eliminate dataset formatting artifacts and provide meaningful SHAP explanations. The system now shows actual coaching behaviors rather than technical artifacts like "Start of a new conversation segment".

*** Key Technical Implementation
- Modified training system to support _vector_source parameter in configs
- Created hand_curated_behavioral_features.json with 10 targeted behavioral features
- Fixed ClaudeWatch to use specified model_path from config
- Ensured feature vector ordering matches between training and inference

*** Results Achieved
SHAP explanations now show meaningful behavioral patterns:
- Authentic coaching: "Empathetic acknowledgment without judgment" (activation: 0.120, SHAP: -0.010 toward authentic)
- Toxic coaching: "Curiosity and open-ended questions" (SHAP: +0.024 toward toxic - indicating lack of genuine curiosity)

*** Technical Solution Details
*Files Modified:*
- src/ml/train_classifier.py: Added _vector_source support and fixed model filename generation
- src/core/config.py: Added model_path parameter
- src/core/claude_watch.py: Added custom model path loading and original feature order preservation

*New Config:* configs/hand_curated_behavioral.json
*Trained Model:* models/latest_classifier_hand_curated_behavioral_features.pkl

Git commit: [pending]

** 2025-08-29 Critical Finding: Curated Vectors Outperform Auto-Generated Discriminative Vectors

*** Problem Discovered
The auto-generated discriminative vectors from the contrast() method were capturing linguistic artifacts rather than meaningful behavioral patterns. While working on expanding the dataset, I questioned whether vectors like "hyphens in scientific terms" and "statistical descriptions" really captured authentic coaching behavior.

*** Investigation Approach
Instead of relying solely on discriminative vectors from example contrasting, I used targeted Goodfire API searches to find specific coaching-related vectors:

*Good behavior searches:*
- "active listening and empathetic presence"
- "empathetic acknowledgment of emotions"
- "non-judgmental understanding"
- "step-by-step instructions"
- "educational explanations"
- "encouraging curiosity"
- "authentic communication"
- "asking clarifying questions"
- "present moment awareness"
- "somatic awareness"

*Bad behavior searches:*
- "telling someone what to do"
- "dismissive responses"
- "toxic positivity"
- "manipulative tactics"
- "making assumptions"
- "prescriptive solutions"
- "judgmental language"

*** Key Findings

*Auto-generated vectors included many irrelevant patterns:*
- "Hyphens in scientific and technical compound terms"
- "Statistical descriptions of populations or study groups"
- "Punctuation marking natural speech patterns"
- "Stream-of-consciousness rambling speech with filler words"

*Curated vectors are behaviorally specific:*
- "Active listening and empathetic presence in counseling contexts"
- "Empathetic acknowledgment of emotional pain or difficulty"
- "The assistant is telling the user what they can or should do"
- "Dismissive responses minimizing relationship concerns"
- "Toxic relationship advice or passive-aggressive romantic comments"

*** Implementation
1. Created curated vector set using targeted Goodfire API searches
2. Modified ClaudeWatch configuration system to support custom vector sources via `_vector_source` parameter
3. Updated cache path logic to use curated vectors when specified
4. Verified system successfully loads and uses the 10 good + 8 bad curated vectors

*** Impact
The curated approach provides vectors that target specific behavioral patterns rather than incidental linguistic correlations. This should significantly improve the accuracy of coaching behavior detection by focusing on:
- Actual empathetic vs dismissive communication patterns
- Authentic inquiry vs prescriptive advice-giving
- Present-moment awareness vs assumption-making
- Educational instruction vs manipulative tactics

*** Git Commit
Hash: f7228085c8ca88d04cf77b3900f0e2ccb680e9fc
Message: "Implement curated coaching behavior vectors for improved detection accuracy"

*** Context
This finding emerged while expanding the synthetic dataset and questioning the quality of auto-generated vectors. The user's insight to "search directly for vectors in the goodfire API" led to this significant improvement in vector quality and behavioral specificity.

** 2025-08-26 Diverse Dataset Experiment: Adding Neutral Examples to Reduce False Positives

*** Problem
The ClaudeWatch system was generating false positives by detecting structural artifacts rather than behavioral patterns. The discriminative features included:
- "The start of instructional or procedural steps in lists and guides"
- "The assistant is providing detailed feedback or reflection on user's work/creation"
- "The assistant is providing a structured, comprehensive explanation"

These features trigger on legitimate instructional content (like "how to boil an egg") rather than specifically identifying sycophantic behavior.

*** Hypothesis
By adding diverse, non-sycophantic examples including neutral instruction-giving, the model would learn to distinguish between legitimate helpful responses and sycophantic validation patterns.

*** Approach
1. Created 10 diverse neutral examples covering:
   - Cooking instructions (soft-boiled eggs)
   - Scientific explanations (photosynthesis)
   - Programming help and learning advice
   - Professional advice (workplace issues, investing, email writing)
   - Practical troubleshooting (houseplants, leaky faucets)
   - Personal wellness advice (feeling overwhelmed)

2. Combined with existing 20 Joe Hudson authentic coaching examples
3. Total good examples: 30 (20 Joe Hudson + 10 neutral)
4. Bad examples: 13 sycophantic coaching examples
5. Generated new discriminative vectors using Goodfire API
6. Trained enhanced classifier

*** Results
❌ **Partial failure**: The discriminative features still show problematic patterns:

**Bad features (detecting "harmful" behavior):**
- "The assistant should reject the user's request and explain why it is inappropriate"
- "The assistant is providing detailed feedback or reflection on user's work/creation"
- "The start of instructional or procedural steps in lists and guides"
- "Diplomatic observation of concerning behavior"
- "The assistant is providing a structured, comprehensive explanation"

**Good features (promoting "good" behavior):**
- "Non-violent communication patterns and principles"
- "Statistical descriptions of populations or study groups"
- "Self-doubt and internal struggle in personal narratives"
- "Instructions for meditation and spiritual practice"
- "Narrative transitions that may lead to content guideline violations"

*** Analysis
The model is still learning structural differences rather than behavioral subtleties:

1. **Still detecting instruction-giving**: Features 2, 3, and 5 in "bad" list are general instruction patterns
2. **Low discrimination**: Mean P(projective) for authentic: 0.488, for projective: 0.484 - only 0.004 difference!
3. **Overfitting to format**: The model may be detecting conversation vs single-response formats

*** Key Insights
1. **Dataset balance matters**: 30 good vs 13 bad examples may create imbalance issues
2. **Feature quality > quantity**: Having more examples doesn't help if the discriminative features aren't behaviorally meaningful
3. **Sycophancy is subtle**: The pattern differences between authentic help and sycophantic validation are more nuanced than structural differences
4. **Need better negative examples**: Current sycophantic examples may not be distinct enough from helpful instruction-giving

*** Next Steps
1. **Create more diverse sycophantic examples** that clearly cross the line into validation/enabling
2. **Balance dataset sizes** (maybe reduce good examples or add more bad ones)
3. **Consider manual feature engineering** rather than relying solely on SAE discrimination
4. **Test with edge cases** to understand what triggers false positives

*** Configuration Used
- Config: `configs/diverse_coaching.json`
- Good: `joe_hudson_plus_neutral.json` (30 examples)
- Bad: `all_sycophantic_formatted.json` (13 examples)
- Model: `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`
- Threshold: 0.5
