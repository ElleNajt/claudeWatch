While left <= right:\n   - Calculate mid = (left + right) // 2\n   - If array[mid] equals target, return mid\n   - If array[mid] < target, set left = mid + 1\n   - If array[mid] > target, set right = mid - 1\n3. If not found, return -1\n\nTime complexity is O(log n). The key insight is that you eliminate half the search space each iteration."

Check variable values at different points\n2. Verify assumptions about data types and formats\n3. Look for off-by-one errors in loops\n4. Check edge cases and null values\n5. Review recent git commits\n\n**Prevention:**\n1. Write unit tests for critical functions\n2. Use linting tools to catch common errors\n3. Code reviews to catch issues early\n4. Follow consistent coding style\n\n**When stuck:**\n1. Take a break - fresh perspective helps\n2. Search Stack Overflow for similar issues\n3. Ask colleague to review with fresh eyes\n4.
