Set a timer for exactly 6-7 minutes (6 for runnier yolk, 7 for jammy)\n4. While eggs cook, prepare an ice bath in a bowl\n5. When timer goes off, immediately transfer eggs to ice bath\n6. Let sit in ice bath for 2 minutes to stop cooking\n7. Gently tap and peel under cool running water\n\nThe key is precise timing and the ice bath to stop the cooking process immediately."

Here's how it works:\n\n**Light-dependent reactions (in chloroplasts):**\n- Chlorophyll absorbs light energy\n- Water molecules split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct\n- Energy is captured in ATP and NADPH molecules\n\n**Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle):**\n- CO2 from air combines with existing plant compounds\n- ATP and NADPH provide energy to form glucose\n- Glucose serves as food for the plant\n\nThe overall equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\nThis process is essential for most life on Earth as it produces oxygen and forms the base of food chains."

That usually points to the cause."

Here's a general approach:\n\n**Before starting:**\n- Turn off water supply (under sink or at main)\n- Plug the drain to avoid losing small parts\n- Take photos before disassembly\n\n**Common fixes by leak location:**\n\n**Spout drip (most common):**\n- Usually worn washer, O-ring, or cartridge\n- Remove handle, then packing nut\n- Replace worn parts with exact matches\n\n**Base/handle leak:**\n- Often loose packing nut or worn O-ring\n- Try tightening packing nut first\n- If that doesn't work, replace O-ring\n\n**Tools you'll likely need:**\n- Adjustable wrench\n- Screwdrivers\n- Pliers\n- Replacement parts (bring old ones to hardware store)\n\n**When to call a plumber:**\n- If you're uncomfortable with the repair\n- If shutoff valves are stuck or leaking\n- If you encounter unexpected complications\n\n**Pro tip:** Take the old parts to the hardware store - they can help identify exactly what you need for your specific faucet model."
